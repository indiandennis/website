      <description>Goal My family bought our house around 4 years ago, and it came with a very interesting home media setup. There are 3 TVs in different rooms of the house, and one projector in the home theater. The home theater and the master bedroom also have 7.1 channel surround sound. Furthermore, the theater has a Panamorph lens which stretches the image to fit the cinemascope projector screen. The inputs and IR blasters for each of the displays connects to a centralized rack in a closet.</description>
