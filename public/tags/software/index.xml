      <description>Introduction Source: https://github.com/indiandennis/CSVtoPDF-public&#xA;I created this simple utility for my Mom&amp;rsquo;s dental practice. She wanted to have patients fill out intake forms before coming into the office (even more necessary than before due to the current pandemic), but needed a HIPAA compliant solution that could result in nicely formatted printed forms. Most professional providers charge upwards of $50 a month for just the HIPAA compliant forms, so I decided to make something to handle it.</description>

      <description>The Goal This project was given to us in several parts over the period of the course, each building on the last. At first, we built a simple primary/backup replicated kv store, which was not very resilient or performant and depended on a resilient view service to manage state. Then, we had to implement the Paxos consensus algorithm in Go. After that, we used that Paxos implementation to create the sharded KV store.</description>

      <description>Youtube Connect Website: https://youtubeconnect.ameyathakur.com&#xA;Introduction This is a simple application I built over the summer to control a Youtube player in the browser from another device. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any particular use for it but thought that it was something cool I could work on,and a feature that is interestingly missing from Youtube. I was inspired by the Spotify Connect feature which I really enjoy using and admire the implementation of.</description>

      <description>At UCLA, students living in dorms on campus (&amp;ldquo;on the hill&amp;rdquo;), get food from the dining halls and takeout locations using prepaid meal swipes. Because there are only a few plans available with a fixed number of swipes, most students end up with either too many or too few swipes by the end of the quarter. In addition, due to the high quality of UCLA&amp;rsquo;s dorm food, many students living off campus want to eat on campus on occasion.</description>

      <description>This project was created for my Introduction to Computer Graphics course as our final project. I worked in a group of three, and we completed project in a span of about 1.5 weeks. The project can be viewed at rocket.ameyathakur.com, although it is not optimized to be delivered over the internet (it uses large textures, etc). You can scroll down to see the controls.&#xA;Our formal writeup for this project is in the readme on Github.</description>
