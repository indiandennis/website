# Goal

My family bought our house around 4 years ago, and it came with a very interesting home media setup. There are 3 TVs in different rooms of the house, and one projector in the home theater. The home theater and the master bedroom also have 7.1 channel surround sound. Furthermore, the theater has a Panamorph lens which stretches the image to fit the cinemascope projector screen. The inputs and IR blasters for each of the displays connects to a centralized rack in a closet. The whole thing was setup to be controlled by Universal Remote Control remotes. The system is advanced for when it was installed (probably around 2008), but today it feels crude and overly complex. There were a few owners of the house after the system's installation, so some devices are missing or misconfigured. I've tried reprogramming the remotes in the past, but they require custom software that Universal Remote Control doesn't provide for all of the remotes. As a result, the system has remained difficult to control and has largely gone unused by my family unless I am at home to start it for them. Despite being installed a decade ago, the displays are still HD and the theater is very nice, so I wanted to modernize the system so that my family could easily use it.



# The Problem

Here is an image of the rack before I began:

To accomplish this goal, I decided that I would need to replace the Universal Remotes with a more intuitive and accessible interface. I also needed to re-wire the rack to remove the connections to removed devices.
