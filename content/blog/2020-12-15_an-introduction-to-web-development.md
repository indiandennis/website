## Preface

I am by no means an authority on web development, but there are a few concepts that are very helpful to learn early on that don't seem to be taught in most online tutorials. This is mostly intended to be a way for me to improve my own understanding by organizing some concepts I've learned over the past few years.

# Intro
Many people are getting into web development by going through tutorials with some framework like React. This is great, but there is a large gap between that knowledge and understanding the web ecosystem more completely. The overwhelming array of frameworks and tools in web development make it difficult to know what to learn next. The purpose of this article is to make the scope of that landscape more clear (and hopefully make your path through it easier).
